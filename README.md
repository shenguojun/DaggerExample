# DaggerExample
Since annotations in dagger2 are hard to understand, this project try to use as many dagger annotations as possible to illustrate their usage. You can checkout and import to idea intellij. If have any problem in build process, please try to rebuild and run again.

Hope this small project can help you understand dagger easier. Have fun.
